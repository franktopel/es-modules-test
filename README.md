To run:

1. Clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/franktopel/es-modules-test.git`.
2. Open a terminal an navigate to the project root folder.
3. Run `npm install` in the terminal.
4. Launch the demo server by running `npm run server`.
5. Open http://192.168.1.54:8080/ in your module-capable browser (Firefox, Safari, Chrome, etc., but **not**  IE).

This repository assumes you have `git` and Node.js along with `npm` up & running.
